### **KEY MECHANICS**

**Healthiness**

The most important aspect of Harold. Healthiness is a measure of how Healthy Harold is; the higher your Healthiness is, the bigger the benefits, and vice-versa. Benefits from Healthiness come in the form of start-of-turn effects and additional effects whenever you play cards. The specific benefits you will receive for your level of Healthiness are described in the "Healthiness" power tooltip.

There are 4 levels of Healthiness: Unhealthy (< 8), Healthy (8 - 18), Very Healthy (18 - 25) and Extremely Healthy (>= 25). Harold starts with 10 Healthiness.

-------------------------

**Shooting**

Certain cards have the ability to Shoot, which is a special form of damage. In the description of the card, the relevant numbers are shown in the form of (A x B, C). "A" is the base damage of each shot, "B" is the number of times to shoot, and "C" is the Critical Chance of each shot. Critical shots deal 2 times the damage.

-------------------------

**Junk**

Junk is a group of tokens that are generated by other cards. They all cost 0 and have useful effects, but also Purge.

-------------------------

**Uncover**

"Uncover" will add a random card to your hand. Its cost is reduced to zero, but it will Purge when played or at the end of your turn.

-------------------------

**Pacifist**

Cards with "Pacifist" will trigger an additional ability when played if there are no Attacks in your hand.

-------------------------

**Technique**

Cards with "Technique" will trigger an additional ability when played if the last card played was also a Technique card.
